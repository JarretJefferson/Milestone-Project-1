# Milestone-Project-1
This is a very basic browser game. the goal is to move the character across the screen and reach the goal point.

I made sure to do my html and css first then went and added the functionality to it with JS. I hope you enjoy and thank you for playing!

Move with WASD
W = move up
A = move left
S = move down
D = move right 

The inspiration I used for this game was old school Mario, I used HTML to create my basis and skeloton for how I wanted this to be, then went to css for the styling and creating the postioning of my chracters. I also used a paint app to create how my characters look and the background, then finished it up with JS to add some functinality to it.

One thing I that is a bit buggy or a obstacle for me was trying to get my Monster characters to move across the screen.
