This is a very basic browser game. the goal is to move the character across the screen and reach the goal point.

I made sure to do my html and css first then went and added the functionality to it with JS. I hope you enjoy and thank you for playing!

Move with WASD
W = move up
A = move left
S = move down
D = move right
